                    An article that compares deep learning and traditional machine learning through real-world applications. 
                    By analyzing machine learning models like Cox regression and convolutional neural networks, this project highlights when and why each approach is most effective. 
                    It demonstrates a practical understanding of model selection based on data type, interpretability, and problem complexity.</p>

                    <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>This project offers a practical comparison between Machine Learning and Deep Learning, focusing on how to choose the right approach based on the problem at hand. Rather than just explaining definitions, it explores real-world healthcare use cases to demonstrate the reasoning behind model selection—highlighting the trade-offs between interpretability, complexity, and data requirements.</p>

                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>To examine and compare the practical applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in healthcare, highlighting the decision-making process behind choosing the appropriate model based on factors such as data type, interpretability, and complexity. This project aims to foster critical thinking in model selection for real-world problem-solving.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>The analysis included two distinct, real-world business problems, each requiring a different machine learning approach. For the first case, a traditional Machine Learning model was used to predict house prices using structured tabular data, emphasizing interpretability and efficiency. In contrast, a Deep Learning model—specifically a Convolutional Neural Network—was applied to an image recognition task involving unstructured visual data, where feature complexity and pattern recognition were critical. Through these examples, the project demonstrates the rationale behind model selection based on data type, complexity, and the need for transparency.</p>

                    <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
                    <p>This project demonstrates a practical understanding of when to apply traditional machine learning versus deep learning, using real-world healthcare applications. By comparing interpretability, data requirements, and model complexity, I highlight how choosing the right tool leads to more effective, ethical, and efficient solutions—especially in high-stakes fields like medicine.</p>
